<h2 id="public-narrative">Public Narrative</h2>
<p>Public narrative can be used to access the emotional resources needed to respond mindfully by mobilizing hope over fear, empathy over alienation, and self-worth over self-doubt.</p>
<p>Leader should be able to tell a &ldquo;story of self&rdquo; that can communicate that values that explain why they have been called to lead.
Leader should be able to tell a &ldquo;story of us&rdquo; that brings alive values their community shares
Lader should be able to tell a &ldquo;story of now&rdquo; of the urgent challenge to those values that requires action.</p>
<p>Narrative is the discursive process through which individuals, communities, and nations make choices, construct identity, and inspire action. The story is how we construct our identity and inspire action.</p>
<p>A major challenge we face as individuals, as a culture, and as a nation is to reclaim our capacity to articulate, draw courage from, and act upon public values. And how we can transform our values into actions.</p>
<p>Understanding what we want to represent has a intrinsic motivation. It brings out the &ldquo;glow&rdquo; from within, rather than how to apply a &ldquo;gloss&rdquo; from without.</p>
<p>We are hard wired to react to anxiety with fear: we run away, we strike out, or we freeze.</p>
<p>Urgency that captures our attention creates the space for new action, but is less about time than it is about priority. The urgent need to complete a problem set due tomorrow supplants the important need to figure out what to do with the rest of life. Commitment and concentration of energy are required to launch anything new, and creating a sense of urgency is often the way to get the focused commitment that is required.</p>
<p>Having &ldquo;positive emotions&rdquo; or hopefulness on any given circumstance redirects our anxiety of uncertainty with courage. The emotion that helps us find courage is hope. Hope is belief in the &ldquo;plausibility of the possible&rdquo; as opposed to the &ldquo;necessity of the probable&rdquo;. While it is always &ldquo;probable&rdquo; that Goliath will win, it is also true that sometimes David wins, a sense of the &ldquo;possible&rdquo; that we experience in our own lives as well. Hope emerges from this sense of possibility, freeing us from the shackles of probability.</p>
<h2 id="the-power-of-story">The Power of Story</h2>
<p>A story is crafted of just three elements: plot, character, and moral. The effect depends on the setting. who tells the story, who listens, where they are, why they are there, and when.</p>
<p><img src="/plot.png" alt="plot"></p>
<p>A plot engages us, captures our interest, and makes us pay attention.
A story begins with an actor moving toward a desired goal. But then some kind of challenge appears. The plan is suddenly up in the air. The actor must figure out what to do. This is when we get interested. We want to find out what happens.</p>
<p>A plot consists of just three elements: a challenge, a choice, and an outcome.</p>
<p>Although a story requires a plot, it only works if we can identify with a character. Through our empathetic identification with a protagonist, we experience the emotional content of the story.
Arguments persuade with evidence, logic, and data. Stories persuade by this empathetic identification.</p>
<h2 id="moral">Moral</h2>
<p>Stories teach. The moral of a successful story is emotionally experienced understanding, not only conceptual understanding, and a lesson of the heart, not ony the head. Stories teach how to manage our emotions, not repress the, so we can act with agency to face our own challenges.</p>
<h2 id="setting">Setting</h2>
<p>Stories are told. They are not messages, sound bites, or brands. Storytelling is fundamentally relational.</p>
<h2 id="story-of-self">Story of Self</h2>
<p>Telling one&rsquo;s story of self is a way to share the values that define who you are &ndash; not as abstract principles, but as lived experience. We construct stories of self around choice points - moments when we faced a challenge, made a choice, experienced an outcome, and learned a moral.</p>
<p>We construct out identity, in other words, as our story. What is utterly unique each of us is not a combination of the categories(race, gender, class, profession) that include us, but rather, our journey, our way through life, our personal text from which each of us can teach.</p>
<p>PRO TIP: Key to good speech is using present tense and avoid using the word &ldquo;and&rdquo;.
eg: I step into the room. It is dark. I hear a sound.</p>
<p>Aristotle argued that rhetoric has three components - logos, pathos, and ethos – this is
ethos.13 The logos is the logic of the argument. The pathos is the feeling the argument evokes.
The ethos is the credibility of the person who makes the argument. – their story of self.</p>
<h2 id="story-of-us">Story of us</h2>
<p>Our cultures are repositories of stories. Stories about challenges we have faced, how we
stood up to them, and how we survived are woven into the fabric of our political culture, faith
traditions, etc. We tell these stories again and again in the form of folk sayings, songs, religious practice, and celebrations. And like individual stories, stories
of us can inspire, teach, offer hope, advise caution, etc. We also weave new stories from old
ones.</p>
<h2 id="story-of-now">Story of Now</h2>
<p>A story of now articulates an urgent challenge - or threat - to the values that we share that demands action now. What choices must we make? What is at risk? And where&rsquo;s the hope?
In a story of now, we are the protagonists and it is our choices that shape the outcome.
In a story of now, story and strategy overlap because a key element in hope is a strategy –
a credible vision of how to get from here to there.</p>
<p>Storytelling is at its most powerful at beginnings &ndash; for individuals, their childhood; for groups, their formation; for movements, their launching; and for nations, their founding. Celebrations are a way we interpret important events, recognize important contributions, acknowledge a common identity, and deepen our sense of community. The way we interpret these moments beings to establish norms, create expectations, and shape patterns of behavior, which tne influence all subsequent development. And we draw on them again and again.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Narrative allow us to communicate the values that motivate the choices that we make. Narrative is not talking &ldquo;about&rdquo; values, rather narrative embodies and communicates values. And it is through the shared experience of our values that we can engage with others, motivate one another to act, and find the courage to take risks, explore possibility and face the challenges we must face.</p>
<h3 id="lecture-notes">Lecture Notes:</h3>
<p>Story should be created in a way to make people take action/make them work by making them emotionally high.
If you share your group values to newcomer then it bridges the gap between the senior member and that member.
It also shapes the action of every individual of a team even though no one is supervising.</p>
<p>Values is what gets passed on for generations.
<em>If you are not gonna tell your story then somebody else will write your story</em></p>
<p><strong>Its not always money that motivates people but stories. Leader should emphasis self worth over self doubt.</strong></p>
<h1 id="why-is-someone-your-leader-even-when-you-are-more-capable">Why is SOMEONE your leader, even when you are more CAPABLE?</h1>
<p>Rather than saying he is not good or he shouldn&rsquo;t be there, you need to show you are better through story. You should demonstrate your skills thorough fact and snatch power.</p>
<h1 id="building-a-story">Building a story</h1>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a past/personal experience which ignited you to pursue this issue then think of the first time you heard this issue and what it made you feel.</p>
<p>You can get work done by either inspiring people or by scaring them. Story of Now can be something that scares people. Create urgency using facts. It should be action driven.</p>
<h1 id="components-of-a-story">Components of a story</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visual</strong>: This people can imagine</li>
<li><strong>Challenge</strong>: Main point</li>
<li><strong>Choice</strong>: What I did. What I choose.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome</strong>: What will happen if we don&rsquo;t do it NOW.</li>
<li><strong>Hope</strong>: Story without a hope won&rsquo;t trigger action.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Why have you chosen your path?</li>
<li>Why did you choose to act on them?</li>
<li>What can they expect from you?</li>
<li>What can they learn from you?</li>
</ol>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to put character in your story. You are the character of your story and it should be genuine.</p>
<h2 id="my-story">My Story</h2>
<p>Self, us, now
Why am I passionate about quality education.
Why I believe that childhood experiences shapes who we are.
How can children from lower class families be prepared for +2 education. How can they compete with students that studied in private colleges.
Times they are changing. Internet has democratized education. Student have access to quality content.
I once saw a video where a child from rural area is asked what he likes to be when he grows up. The naive kid don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s possible, he was never encouraged to dream big. He doesn&rsquo;t understand the weight of the question. He replies &ldquo;I want to be a driver&rdquo;. Which could be the only job in his village which does not require manual labor and make a decent wage. It&rsquo;s break my heart when two children of same age can&rsquo;t have similar aspirations due to lack of education.</p>
<p>Self.
My childhood was mind-numbingly, painfully ordinary. Neither was I a problem child, nor I was a parent&rsquo;s lottery. Just an average nobody. I had no interest in school and it&rsquo;s coursework. Assignments were hurriedly copied the day of the submission. Classrooms were boring as it can get. Teachers were spiritless and friends as clueless as me. After school  was when all the fun started cause it was time to play. Football, cricket, table tennis, basketball you name it, I enjoyed playing everything. Sports was a break for me and my friends from the mundane school work. We felt that school was a cruel concept that adult people came up with to restrict us from having fun.</p>
<p>This all changed after the arrival of facebook. Facebook brought mass acceptance of Internet in my circle. More people wanted to be connected to the Internet. I started spending more time inside, surfing web than playing sports. It was difficult to find an decent ground due to massive construction happening at the period and we felt glad that we at least had Internet and massive entertainment content to pass time. And I watched a lot of movies. I can proudly say, looking back, that I learned more from watching english movies than 10 years of school.</p>
<p>Us.
For our generation who grew up with rote learning and believing that if we can&rsquo;t memorize this difficult chemistry equation then there is something wrong with us. The teachers who solidify this belief in us, who shamelessly said that &ldquo;pachi kehi garna sakdainas tailay&rdquo; because we didn&rsquo;t want to memorize things that didn&rsquo;t make sense to us.</p>
<p>I believe that we are a unique generation and have a unique problem. Our parents grew up without a good education, with hardship and fortitude to fight system and at the same time making a living doing something. Education for them was the only way to a good life. They have taken a vow to never let their children go through similar hardship, to let their children focus on their study. Education is the key to my child&rsquo;s glorious life&quot;. Under this beautiful aspiration, is a misguided knowledge about what education is supposed to be. Seeing this opportunity to graps, some clever people made business out of education. You have all the time in life to learn but no one to tell you how to. You are judged on your performance in exam but no one to correct you in your mistakes. If childhood education shapes who we are then? What are we gonna become with such education? Who is gonna tell my parents that exam won&rsquo;t matter when the exam result is the only thing they can measure and use to compare how great their children is?</p>
<p>How are they suppose to compete with you?</p>
<p>Now/Urgency
While we are having global aspirations, while we have seen what quality education motivates people to do/act. We need to act now, we need to share what we know so people won&rsquo;t be left out.</p>
